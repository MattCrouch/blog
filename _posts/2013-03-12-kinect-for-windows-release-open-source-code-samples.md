You've been able to download code samples through the Kinect for Windows Developer Toolkit for a while now, but that whole experience always seemed a bit clunky to me. Sometimes they can show overly basic projects, but also overly complex ones too under the same hat.

While all that's staying put, the Kinect for Windows dev team just released their code samples for you to get your head around. They're great if you're looking to get your head around a particular concept, as they're separated into providing insights into separate functions of the Kinect SDK. It includes stuff right down to simple depth stream data, so if you're struggling to get your feet off the ground, there might be a good place to springboard your apps from.

Not only are they handy to get your head around functionality, they're also released as open source, so you're free to grab their work and use it in your project as you see fit - an idea Microsoft seem to be championing as of late. Also, you can subscribe to a piece of code, so if it changes you can be notified and update your code accordingly.

So if you're looking for that little bit of help, check out the newly created [Kinect for Windows Development Blog][Kinect for Windows Development Blog]Â for links to the samples, and don't forget to subscribe to that blog too as I'm sure they'll churn out some very useful bits of information for your next Kinect project!
