<p>It's been a while since I posted here, but I've been a little busy. One of those things is that I've done a talk for BarCamp Bournemouth. It's all about my experience with developing stuff with Kinect as a student, and how difficult it is to design an interface for everyone.</p>
<p>In reality it's pretty difficult to design an interface for everyone that relies on some predefined knowledge of how a Kinect actually works as there's literally no standard way for people to learn. This talk covered what we could do to alleviate these problems, but in essence, people are always different.</p>
<p>Here's the talk on <a title="SlideShare presentation" href="http://www.slideshare.net/Matt_Crouch/bcbomo" target="_blank">SlideShare</a> which doesn't have the pretty swooshy animations which is a shame.</p>
