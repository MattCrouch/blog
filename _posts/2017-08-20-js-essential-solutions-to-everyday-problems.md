The latest edition of [Web Designer][Web Designer] features a bit more of me than the usual. This time I dive into some common questions JavaScript developers are going to need answering at some point.

There's plenty there to get stuck into. We discuss weighty topics like performance and future-proofing, as well as more specific questions like how JavaScript can improve accessibility.

There's an entire section devoted to whether jQuery is still relevent when developing sites today. In general, you're much better off just using native JavaScript instead of loading a chunky lump of code in - and that doesn't just go for jQuery. But I do stick up for the decade-old framework in some respects.

If my ramblings aren't quite as in-depth as you would like, ShopTalk Show recently did an entire episode on [Vanilla JS][ShopTalk Show - Vanilla JS with Chris Ferdinandi] that covers a lot of what I mention and more. Definitely worth checking out if you've not listened to it already.

I also give a shout out on who to follow on Twitter to get the latest in the world of JavaScript. Plus where you should go to learn those new things. One of which is [FunFunFunction][FunFunFunction YouTube Channel] by Mattias P Johansson, who just decided to make those videos full time! So now is a great time to get on board.

So pick up a copy, let me know your thoughts. Although please don't point out any editing mishaps. Unlike the web, we can't just issue a patch for these things...
