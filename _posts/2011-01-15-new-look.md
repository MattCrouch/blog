<p>Nothing really exciting update-wise, just dropping in to say that the blog has had a little nip and tuck here and there, so now it looks a bit more fresh.</p>
<p>Before it looked pretty fancy, then some problem with the update procedure in Wordpress destroyed the old theme leaving me with a very old theme that was only supposed to be temporary at the time. My bad. </p>
<p>But hey, now we've got this new fancy HTML5-y one. Swish. </p>
<p>Updates now also come through the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/PkMnTrainerMatt">@PkMnTrainerMatt</a> account on Twitter, so follow that if RSS feeds aren't your scene. (Oh, and the RSS is now on <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattcrouch/devblog">Feedburner</a>, too).</p>
<p>So yes. Hope to see you get your updates about my stuff from here soon enough. </p>
<p>Cheers guys!</p>
