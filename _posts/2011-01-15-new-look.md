Nothing really exciting update-wise, just dropping in to say that the blog has had a little nip and tuck here and there, so now it looks a bit more fresh.

Before it looked pretty fancy, then some problem with the update procedure in Wordpress destroyed the old theme leaving me with a very old theme that was only supposed to be temporary at the time. My bad. 

But hey, now we've got this new fancy HTML5-y one. Swish. 

So yes. Hope to see you get your updates about my stuff from here soon enough. 

Cheers guys!
