The latest edition of [Web Designer][Web Designer] carries a tutorial I made for creating an autocomplete component with Polymer. It's a lot easier than you might think!

Now I must admit, when writing this I wasn't overly familiar with Polymer myself. If you're in a similar boat yourself, here's a little primer.

[Polymer][Polymer] is a framework built by Google. It's built to help utilise the features of web components with added helpful features you find in frameworks nowadays like data-binding and lifecycle callbacks.

In this tutorial, we make an autocomplete component to easily search names of people. The idea being you can just add in the <code>app-autocomplete</code> component, give it a data source and you're ready to go. It's reusable, flexible and above all else easy to make.

If you're interested in Polymer at all, there's a [free 2-day web summit][Polymer Summit] over in Tobacco Dock in London to help you get up to speed and get all the best features out of it. There's a lot more information up for grabs there than I could ever fit in a 5 page tutorial!
