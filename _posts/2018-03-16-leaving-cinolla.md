After nearly six years, it's time to say goodbye to Cinolla as I leave the team.

I started at Beetleweb originally as a placement for my university course. Afterwards, they invited me back to go full-time. That was June 2012. The London Olympics hadn't even started then.

Over that time, I've worked on a bunch of different products for Lush and a few other local companies. One for a little watersports company based in Poole that, it turns out, kicked off a whole new venture in what is now called [Cinolla][Cinolla].

As the feature set grew, so did the centres using it. At the time I write this, it's nearing its 200,000th booking at over 120 centres across the UK and overseas. It doesn't show any signs of stopping either. That's nuts.

I've built so much stuff from staff and qualification systems to membership management platforms and lots of bespoke builds for specific centre's needs. A lot of that is sticking around for a while at least, so I'm happy to have something lasting within it.

6053 commits later I'm off. Not because of the project, or the people, but for change. Nearly six years in a first job is crazy, but as a testament to the guys I was happy to stay. While I'm in London and I'm young(ish) still, though, it's best to try something different. 

I'm off to join the team at [Vidsy][Vidsy] next week for a different adventure. Who knows what that has in store for me, but I shall be forever grateful to Rob, Dave and everyone else involved in Cinolla over the years for all they've done. It's been great.
