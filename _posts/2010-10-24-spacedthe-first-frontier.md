The first task of our second year was to create a game in [Unity 3D][Unity] – a game engine that's free to download. There's plenty of games, both in browser and downloadable, that use it and so it only seems logical that we should give it a go and see what it's like.

Now, in a week you're never going to make a brilliant game. But Spaced is my attempt at that. Right now it's a pretty basic "move the ship and collect the coins" kind of deal, but hopefully if you're reading this sometime after Christmas, it's a whole lot more than that. 

So, this being a development blog, I thought I would share whatever gets updated within the game here. At some point I'll also go over how some of the current (read, basic) mechanisms work, so if you're a complete Unity 3D novice, you'll have some comfort realising what I found particularly challenging.
