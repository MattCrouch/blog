<p>The first task of our second year was to create a game in <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity 3D</a> – a game engine that's free to download. There's plenty of games, both in browser and downloadable, that use it and so it only seems logical that we should give it a go and see what it's like.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mattcrouch.net/portfolio/work/spaced/"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="1" border="0" alt="1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1_thumb.png" width="353" height="126" /></a></p>
<p>Now, in a week you're never going to make a brilliant game. But Spaced is my attempt at that. You can see whatever state it's currently at over on <a href="http://www.mattcrouch.net/portfolio/insight.php?p=spaced">my portfolio</a>. Right now it's a pretty basic &quot;move the ship and collect the coins&quot; kind of deal, but hopefully if you're reading this sometime after Christmas, it's a whole lot more than that. </p>
<p>So, this being a development blog, I thought I would share whatever gets updated within the game here. At some point I'll also go over how some of the current (read, basic) mechanisms work, so if you're a complete Unity 3D novice, you'll have some comfort realising what I found particularly challenging. </p>
<p>Still, <a href="http://www.mattcrouch.net/portfolio/work/spaced/">play Spaced</a> and let me know what you think and what needs improving in the comments. Always loving to hear from the people of the Internet (so long as it isn't about that Astley fellow – he doesn't give anyone up).</p>
