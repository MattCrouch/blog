<p>I'm about to go through a massive change in my day to day life. I'm moving to London. Crikey.</p>
<p>I've been in the Bournemouth/Poole area for the past four years thanks to work and university. It's lovely here, it really is. But there's always room for change...</p>
<p><a href="http://mattcrouch.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/adventure-may-kill-you.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-334" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/adventure-may-kill-you-300x225.jpeg" alt="&quot;Adventure may hurt you, but monotony will kill you&quot;" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>This is a sticker I found - of all places - on the stairs going up to where I work. Certainly words that resonate with me, at least. Like I said, Poole is a lovely place, but it's a lovely place to retire to. When you've seen all to see, done all to do, then it's time to settle in to the morning paper run and making time just to sit and watch the sea.</p>
<p>See, I love doing that, but this is really the start of my life. This shouldn't be the be all and end all.</p>
<p>I'm moving to London (Acton, to be specific) and seeing what that can bring me. That's purely the reason I'm leaving here - just to see what might happen. I'm not really one to dwell on something, and sit there knowing something could be happening that I'm not apart of.</p>
<p>Having said that, I'm keeping my job. My boss has been ever so kind to let me work from my laptop wherever I may be. So that gives me freedom to work wherever I like, essentially. Get to know the people, who know people, who can make connections for the better. Super duper.</p>
<p>I'm super excited to see what comes out of it all, but I'm going to miss Bournemouth and Poole a lot. Especially in the summer.</p>

<p>I see Bournemouth as my Viridian City. For those who aren't 90s children, or weren't brainwashed as a child, Viridian City is the second city you visit in the original Pokemon games, just after your home of Pallet Town. But there's not much there. You chat to a few people, there's a drunk guy, but that's about it until you go through the entire Pokemon region. The last badge before you hit the Elite Four resides here, in Viridian City.</p>
<p>I'll be back, certainly. Work will need me in sometimes, there's <a title="B&amp;W Meet" href="http://www.bwmeet.co.uk/" target="_blank">B&amp;W Meet</a>s and <a title="HACKBMTH" href="http://hackbmth.org/" target="_blank">HACKBMTH</a>s to attend, and I just know too many people down here to just up and leave. Plus, I would be missing out on views like<span style="color: #d54e21;">Â </span><a style="font-size: inherit; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; color: #d54e21; text-decoration: underline;" title="Twitter.com - stupler" href="https://twitter.com/stupler/status/353947385082310656/photo/1" target="_blank">this</a>. And that's mad.</p>
<p>But the best is yet to come, I'm sure. Who knows what good/bad London might bring. I guess that's half the fun...</p>
