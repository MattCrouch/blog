React is crying out for a good solution to application-wide state management. While the newer [context API][context api] provides a solution, but it might not be suitable to all projects.

In the latest [Web Designer][web designer] we go through the different concepts in Redux.

It's the first in a five-part series, which goes on to cover different topics such as immutability, form building and testing what we make.

Redux is an intimidating beast. That's certainly how I felt when I first came to use it. There's so many different concepts and lots of boilerplate to put in the right place (where even _is_ the right place?) that getting started seems very daunting at the start.

Thankfully, Redux itself is quite simple in itself - we just choose to make it more complicated than it needs to be.

This issue is a gentle introduction to a few key concepts within Redux - such as actions and reducers. We won't exactly be breaking new ground with this tutorial, but it's at least more than a todo list ðŸ˜´

Over the series we will be making PhotoShare - an application where users can comment on photos by clicking on them. There's a bit of everything involved over the five parts, but this first one will just be using data from a JSON file.

That's all waiting in [Web Designer 282][web designer] right now! Go pick up a copy!
