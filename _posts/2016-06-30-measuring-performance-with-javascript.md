I've written a thing! It's all about JavaScript. You might have guessed that part.

There's a little known window object in JS called <code>performance</code>. It measures the time stuff takes to get done.

In the latest edition of [Web Designer][Web Designer], I talk you through the steps you need to go through to get that useful data out and send it back for analysis.

It's available wherever you would find a nerdy magazine - including WHSmith. It's the illusive 250th edition, too. Seeing as it's got my face in it, it's also a collectors item.
