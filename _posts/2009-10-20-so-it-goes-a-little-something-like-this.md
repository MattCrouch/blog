<p>So welcome, first of all! hey there. Welcome to my little development space on the Interwebs. It's not much so far but hey, I've only just started my course!</p>
<p>My name's Matt Crouch (obviously), currently 18 and studying for a BA in Interactive Media Production at Bournemouth University. That might not mean a lot to you right now, but let's try and make things a little clearer, now...</p>
<p>Interactive Media is probably something you'll know more about if I called it "Facebook and that" (Hey, I knew I would) but it's not just that simple. Interactive Media covers the scopes of things like game design, websites, blogs, podcasting and generally all the media stuff that you end users will end up interacting with. We learn what makes you tick, what you're not a great fan of and where you might go in the future.</p>
<p>So over the next few years (and hopefully beyond) you'll see how my projects come to be. Some things will be shown in more detail than others, but generally you'll be able to see the project through to the end. I'll share what works and why it does and even where I need to improve. You could chip in too, if you like - that's the awesome thing about blogs!</p>
<p>So yeah. In short, welcome to the home of my inspirations.</p>
