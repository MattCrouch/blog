<p>Success! I passed my first year of Interactive Media Production at Bournemouth Uni. Go me! But that's not really what this post is about.</p>
<p>What that means is that I'm a second year now – the middle year – so I'll be doing a bit more stuff in depth and specialist. For example, this first term we cover Unity 3D and HTML5 as well as more advanced PHP and Flash-related things. It's pretty much going to be all new stuff to me.</p>
<p>So expect some more posts on here about what's what. The first thing up is Unity 3D, so that's going to be a steep learning curve for me. Watch my progress and such!</p>
<h5>What's coming up?</h5>
<p>But what else should there be? Well, aside from strictly course-related mutterings here, I will on occasion post something that I've been playing around with and explain how it came to be. It's not much more than flexing my ever so pathetic production muscles, but it's not a literal metaphor, so it's all good.</p>
<p>I'll probably be knocking around with a bit of Flash and/or video stuff for the Proffesional Studies section we have in February, but you'll hear more about that when the time comes. </p>
<p>Let's see what I come up with, shall we?</p>
