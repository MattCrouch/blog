I’ve created a 13-minute video to get you running your first Kinect for Windows code, going through every stage right from opening up a blank C# and WPF project.

If you’ve got any questions, do let me know, but there’s not a lot here that’s massively confusing in the grand scheme of things, so keep at it :)
