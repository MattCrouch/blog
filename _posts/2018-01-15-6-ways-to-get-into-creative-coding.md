Welcome to 2018! What better way to see in the new year than by learning something new? While a whole new project can be daunting, how about something a little more freeform? In this month's [Web Designer][Web Designer] dive head first into the wonderful world of creative coding.

First off, what is creative coding? It doesn't have an exact definition, but it would be any kind of coding that isn't wholly practical in nature. Nobody has fun writing another CRUD application. Creative coding is all about stretching those creative muscles that have long since been forgotten about for a lot of developers out there.

The form that takes can be anything. Abstract art pieces are a great place to start. I came across [Dwitter][Dwitter Hello World] a fraction too late for the article. It's essentially Twitter for creative chunks of JavaScript. See what chaos you can make in 140 characters or less. Have that one as a freebie!

This article goes through six different ways you can start getting creative. From using different data sources such as the Twitter API to device sensors and more. Why not ditch the browser altogether and enter the wonderful world of WebVR?

Pick up a copy and see what's possible with the tech of today - and tomorrow - and learn something new in the process. Win win, right?
