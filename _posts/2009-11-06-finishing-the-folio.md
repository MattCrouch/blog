Another quick update on the folio situation. Keeping things short and sweet – well – it's almost finished. Happy days.

[![Folio][Folio]][Folio]

The design made its way into Photoshop and has also found a nice partnership with its best mates, CSS and HTML. Those guys never go anywhere without each other.

It's also now up on Mattcrouch.net, too. Just head over to [MattCrouch.net][MattCrouch.net] and you can see where it's at right now. But it's getting there.

Not all of it's functional yet, because I've still got some stuff to work out. Namely the code I need to get the images to cycle for each entry. But, every little helps.

After that, the next's step is to populate the rest of the pages, then it's on to the homepage!
