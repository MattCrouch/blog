<p>Another quick update on the folio situation. Keeping things short and sweet – well – it's almost finished. Happy days.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mattcrouch.net/blog/images/FinishingtheFolio_D53A/Folio.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="Folio" border="0" alt="Folio" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Folio_thumb.png" width="244" height="176" /></a> </p>
<p>The design made its way into Photoshop and has also found a nice partnership with its best mates, CSS and HTML. Those guys never go anywhere without each other.</p>
<p>It's also now up on Mattcrouch.net, too. Just head over to <a href="http://www.mattcrouch.net/folio">mattcrouch.net/folio</a> and you can see where it's at right now. But it's getting there.</p>
<p>Not all of it's functional yet, because I've still got some stuff to work out. Namely the code I need to get the images to cycle for each entry. But, every little helps.</p>
<p>After that, the next's step is to populate the rest of the pages, then it's on to the homepage!</p>
