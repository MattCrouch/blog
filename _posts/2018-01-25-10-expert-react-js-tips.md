There's no denying that React has taken over as king of the frameworks - for now at least. Suppose you've finally got round to learning how it all works, where do you go from there? In the latest issue of [Net Magazine][Net Magazine], you can find out.

Once you "get" React it's almost like beating that final boss at the end of the game. Is that it? What now? Well, there's all the rest of the gems to go and collect, hidden areas to access and battle modes to perfect. Getting to the end product is one thing, but there's still plenty left to master.

The hands-off approach the React developers have taken to project structure leads to some creative uses of components and functionality that you don't see as much on different platforms. Some work better for certain projects than others but they all benefit a project in some way.

This issue covers some of my favourite nuggets I've collected on my travels. Some are fairly long in the tooth by framework standards, but others like portals and error boundaries are great updates you might not even be aware of.

I've been using React for nearing on a year now with Cinolla's redesigned customer portal. There's even a case study in there about how all those tips pull together to produce real results in a real project. If that doesn't convince you, nothing will.

Don't forget, go pick up a copy of [Net Magazine][Net Magazine] in... pretty much anywhere that stocks magazines, really.

Sidenote - _Really_ not a fan of the "expert" in that title. Their choice, not mine. My goal is to help build your React knowledge, not spout some "holier than thou" doctrine on to you. Do what works for you. If that's what is outlined here, then super! :)
