The pitch has been pitched, and it’s just waiting for the results of that pitch to make their way to me.

In the mean time however I’ve uploaded the slides and notes of that pitch to SlideShare if you want to have a nose at it. It’s nothing special really and, without context, might not mean much. But you might want to view it!
