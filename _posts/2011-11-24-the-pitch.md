<p>The pitch has been pitched, and it’s just waiting for the results of that pitch to make their way to me.</p>
<p>In the mean time however I’ve uploaded the slides and notes of that pitch to SlideShare if you want to have a nose at it. It’s nothing special really and, without context, might not mean much. But you might want to view it!</p>
