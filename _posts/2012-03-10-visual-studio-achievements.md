<p>As a means of procrastination while still having Visual Studio open, I buckled and installed <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/achievements/visualstudio">Visual Studio Achievements</a> as an extension to it. So now whenever I do some code well (or, apparently, badly) it’ll let me know and post it to the website.</p>
<p>Nothing beats a bit of gamification, does it?</p>
<p>So you can follow the trials and tribulations of creating Moto over at <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/niners/MattCrouch/achievements/visualstudio">my profile on Coding4Fun</a>. I can only apologise if I get all the bad practice ones first. I’m a massive n00b. </p>
