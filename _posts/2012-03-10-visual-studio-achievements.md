As a means of procrastination while still having Visual Studio open, I buckled and installed [Visual Studio Achievements][Visual Studio Achievements] as an extension to it. So now whenever I do some code well (or, apparently, badly) it’ll let me know and post it to the website.

Nothing beats a bit of gamification, does it?

So you can follow the trials and tribulations of creating Moto over on my profile at [Coding4Fun][Coding4Fun Profile]. I can only apologise if I get all the bad practice ones first. I’m a massive n00b.
