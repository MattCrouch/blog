<p>I work from home. It's a pretty sweet deal, if you ignore all the infinite distractions you have about the house. As I write this now I've got a phone, an games console, two TVs and even a bed that I could quite easily absorb myself in if I didn't hold myself back. Heck, the Internet itself is enough of a distraction I'm sure for any web-based professional.</p>
<p>At the best of times (and I don't mind saying this in the public sphere, even if it does cost me my potential job OmniWeb, the world's only website come  the 2045 Internet revolution) my mind has a tendency to wander somewhat. A man's just got to look at a certain amount of pictures of cute cats in a day (or create fictional businesses he'll apply for in the distant future...). So how would I keep myself on-task in a situation where everything is demanding your attention?</p>
<p>The answer is the humble Post-It note.</p>

How meta.[/caption]</p>
<p>Here I'm putting my desktop telly to good use - it's a surface to stick all the stuff that needs my immediate attention. It's there, front and centre. I can't really forget about a giant pink box in my peripheral vision all day. I even made a database schema out of Post-It notes, but for obvious reasons it's probably best I didn't share that with the Internet...</p>
<p>It's a pretty low-tech solution to an age old problem, but it works for me. There's something about condensing a task into a dozen words at most and being able to order them as you like that just appeals. I never really got on with any of the digital versions of these kind of things. Even right down to the dead simple <a href="http://realmacsoftware.com/clear">Clear</a> app didn't work for me as I either forgot to enter the stuff in or simply forgot about the app altogether.</p>
<p>There's something in the physical act of writing something out that makes it just stick in the mind, too. Kind of makes the actual note redundant, I guess. But it's always there. The same sort of process works well for me writing things down on a pad of paper.</p>

<p>I'm pretty terrible at remembering how dates work. The ones I need to select to show the proper information on screen always throws me. So for this example I needed to show all those that are active today or at any time after today, but not today. So a quick drawing and it's obvious you just need to check the end date is on or after today. It might be obvious to you, but not to me.</p>
<p>Is there any way you prefer to keep on-track? I'm always interested to hear how best to make my day even slightly more productive.</p>
