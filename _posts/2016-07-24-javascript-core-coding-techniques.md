I've written another thing for [Web Designer][Web Designer]! This time it's all about getting to use ES2015 today thanks to the use of some nifty transpilers.

Through the use of Babel or some other kind of ES2015 to ES5 conversion tool you can write code using the new standard that will work on code using the old standard. 

This article goes through the top 10 features of ES2015 - from the building blocks like <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> right up to the big complex stuff like modules and generators.

It's out now if you wanted to take a look. You never know, you might even learn a thing or two along the way!
