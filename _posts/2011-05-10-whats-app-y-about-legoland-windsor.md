There's plenty of obvious places for a mobile app to be implemented – think The Gadget Show Live or the Tate Modern gallery – where there's more information that needs to be gathered on a personal level. But why would anyone need or even want to use a mobile app while they're pottering around Legoland Windsor?

## Map in your pocket

What's the first thing you do when you head into a theme park? You find a map. Either one of those giant ones everyone can see, or a small paper one that you stick in your pocket and forget about until it's in multiple, mushy pieces after that soggy trip on the log flume. 

Then you're stuck using reference points to try and figure your way to the next attraction. Why not just have a map that shows you where you are? You can whip it out and see what's around you. It can also help you make the most of your day so you're not spent travelling from one end to the other for half the day.

## Time team

When you eventually find the place you want to go, you're inevitably struck back by the sign that displays in big red lettering "Wait time approx. 120 mins". Biggest let-down ever. Especially at a place like Legoland. Nobody wants to be in charge of an impatient child who needs to wee while you're half way into the queue.

With an app on your phone that tells you what the queues are like before you get there, you can plan your trip before you even get there. If there's a show you want to go and see the Lego Racers 4D Adventure starts in half an hour, you don't want to be waiting an hour before getting on your next ride. The app can tell you when the best time to start heading towards the show is and even alert you if you've set it up to do so. Sorted.

## It's the little things

Kids can be difficult to keep entertained. I get that. The only thing likely to entertain them are loud noises and dangerous things – two things that probably shouldn't be within your child's grasp in public.

So taking a leap out of [Thorpe Park's book][Researching Ideas for a Legoland App] I reckon some queue-side entertainment could be good. Perhaps a quiz or a game or something. How about taking their picture for the Legoland driving school license? Simple, little things to make them happy.

But what if the kids get bored of queuing altogether? Well, I propose the idea of the park-wide quest. Using the GPS in the phone to track your movements, challenge the family to go and find a particular attraction. When they're near it, you've completed the challenge. Complete a certain amount of challenges for money off at the gift shop, for example. Anything to get some fun into people and get them spending, right?

## But it's all up in the air

Unfortunately, while I'd love to make a fully amazing app for everything, but there's just not enough time. I'll need to prioritise the core nature of the app and then add in extra features if I have the time.

It's the first mobile app I'll have ever made though, so I can't expect miracles. But we'll see. Watch this space, yeah?
