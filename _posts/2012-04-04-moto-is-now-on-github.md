<p>Here’s something I’m trying out – <a href="http://www.mattcrouch.net/moto/">Moto</a> is now on Github. Crikey.</p>
<p>Partly as a place of backup, but partly as an effort to keep a tabs on my changes. So you can now see my changes as well. It’s all very… open, now.</p>
<p>That’s where you can find the latest version of Moto too. The download link on the Moto homepage now redirects there. It should help me keep a tab on what exactly has changed between releases.</p>
