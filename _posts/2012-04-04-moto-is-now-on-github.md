Here’s something I’m trying out – [Moto][Moto] is now on [Github][Moto Github]. Crikey.

Partly as a place of backup, but partly as an effort to keep a tabs on my changes. So you can now see my changes as well. It’s all very… open, now.
That’s where you can find the latest version of Moto too. The download link on the Moto homepage now redirects there. It should help me keep a tab on what exactly has changed between releases.
